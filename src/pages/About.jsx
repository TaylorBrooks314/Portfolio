      <p className="p1">
        In 2022, while in college, I stumbled upon a computer science class
        and signed up. I thought it sounded intresting. Never did I imagine that 
        I would end up loving coding so much that I would leave college and join a coding bootcamp.
        However that is exactly what I did.</p>
      <p className="p2">
        In May of 2023 I start with Activate Work powered by Per Scholas. I graduated from that 
        program in early September 2023. Through that bootcamp I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the MERN
        Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I also got the opportunity to develop my transferable skills 
        like communication and time management.
      </p>
      <p className="p3">
        Post graduation, I found an opportunity to become a Software Engineer Apprentice and leaped at it. That apprenticeship program began with 18 weeks of training where I continued to develop my skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS and gain new skills such as PostgreSQL and Java. I graduated from training in July of 2024. My main focus after training will be to get more experience wokring within a company. My main motivation for coding is that fact that it provides me with chance to use my knowledge and problem solving skills to create something that can be a solution
        to someone's issues and impact their life. This leads me to find a company to work for that is people and mission oriented. 
      </p>
      <p className="lastp">
        When I am not coding you can find me fishing, hiking, hanging out with my husband and son, 
        or solving a puzzle of some sort.
